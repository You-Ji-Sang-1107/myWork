# Some Terminologies

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): An environment tool when programmers want to develop software.

Note: Software(SW) controls Hardware(HW).

In Java, we have 3 programming paradigms:
1. Procedural Programming
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Generic Programming

Computer Programs: process data under the control of instructions.
## Computer Organization

## A computer system is typically organized into five main logical units
|Unit|Function|
|----|--------|
|Input Unit|Receives data from external devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner) and converts it into a format that the computer can understand.|
|Output Unit|Displays or presents data to the user (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers).|
|Memory Unit|Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently. <br> It consists of two main types: <br> - Primary Memory (RAM): Volatile memory used for active programs and data. <br> - Secondary Memory (Hard Drive, SSD): Non-volatile memory for long-term storage.|
|Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)|Performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) on data.|
|Control Unit|Coordinates the activities of all other units, fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them.|

## Data Hierarchy

Data Hierarchy is a systematic organization of data, often in a hierarchical form. It represents the relationships between different levels of data elements, helping to understand and manage data effectively.

Key Levels in Data Hierarchy
1. Bit: The smallest unit of data, representing a binary value (0 or 1).  
2. Byte: A group of 8 bits, representing a single character.  
3. Field: A collection of related characters representing a single piece of information (e.g., name, age, address).  
4. Record: A group of related fields representing a single entity (e.g., a customer record, an employee record).  
5. File: A collection of related records.  
6. Database: A collection of related files.

Importance of Data Hierarchy:
 - Data Organization: Provides a structured way to organize and manage data.  
 - Data Retrieval: Facilitates efficient data retrieval and processing.  
 - Data Integrity: Helps maintain data consistency and accuracy.  
 - Data Security: Enables better control over data access and security.  
 - Data Analysis: Supports data analysis and decision-making.


## Machine Language, Assembly Language, High-level language

 - Machine language: the most basic level, directly understood by the computer.
 - Assembly language: a step up, using mnemonics for better readability.
 - High-level language: the most abstract, offering the highest level of abstraction for human programmers.

## Object Technology

- Class: blueprint of making an object.
- Object: reusable SW component. 
- Method: performing  a task in a program(function)
- Instantiation: object made by a specific class with its methods. This object is called an instance.
- Attribute: a characteristic or property associated with an object or a class. It's essentially a variable that holds data specific to an object or a class.
- Encapsulation by a class
- Inheritance: the subclass starts with the characteristics of an existing class called superclass.
- Interfaces: collections of related methods that enable them to tell objects what to do. (It implements one or more interfaces.)


## Unified Modeling Language(UML)
Unified Modeling Language(UML): A general-purpose visual modeling language that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

## Operating System (OS)
The OS is like the driver and the traffic controller of a computer.
Key Roles of the OS:
1. Manages Hardware:
 - Communicates with all the parts of your computer (CPU, RAM, hard drive, mouse, keyboard, etc.).
 - Allocates resources like CPU time and memory to different programs.
 - Handles input/output operations (like when you type or click).
2. Provides a User Interface:
 - Gives you a way to interact with the computer (like the Windows desktop or the macOS interface).
 - Lets you run programs and manage files.
3. Manages Software:
 - Loads and executes programs.
 - Provides a platform for other software to run on.
 - Handles memory management for programs.
4. Ensures Security:
 - Protects your computer from viruses and malware.
 - Controls access to your files and data.
