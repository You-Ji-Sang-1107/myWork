## Some Terminologies

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): An environment tool when programmers want to develop software.

Note: Software(SW) controls Hardware(HW).

In Java, we have 3 programming paradigms:
1. Procedural Programming
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Generic Programming

Computer Programs: process data under the control of instructions.
## Computer Organization

## A computer system is typically organized into five main logical units
|Unit|Function|
|----|--------|
|Input Unit|Receives data from external devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner) and converts it into a format that the computer can understand.|
|Output Unit|Displays or presents data to the user (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers).|
|Memory Unit|Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently. <br> It consists of two main types: <br> - Primary Memory (RAM): Volatile memory used for active programs and data. <br> - Secondary Memory (Hard Drive, SSD): Non-volatile memory for long-term storage.|
|Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)|Performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) on data.|
|Control Unit|Coordinates the activities of all other units, fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them.|
