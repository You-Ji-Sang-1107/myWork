# Chapter 3. 직교성(Orthogonality)

L^2 normed space: ||x||**2 = x'x (x'는 x의 전치행렬(벡터)를 의미)


직교 <=> x'y = 0: x와 y는 서로 직교한다.(단, 영벡터가 아니어야한다.)

Theorem 1
If non-zero vectors v_1, ..., v_k are mutually orthogonal, then these vectors are linearly independent.


pf) Let i be any number in 1, 2, ..., k. Then, (v_i)'(c_1*v_1 + ... + c_k*v_k) = (v_i)'v_i*c_i = 0
Since i is any number in 1, 2 , ..., k, all c_i = 0. Therefore, linearly independent.


2 subspaces V and W of the same Euclidean space are orthogonal if every vector v in V is orthogonal to every vector w in W. i.e.) v'w = for all v and w.


*Every matrix transforms its row space onto its column space.

### 최소제곱법(Least Square Method)

When Ax=b is inconsistent, its least square solution minimizes $||Ax-b||^2$
#### Normal Equation(정규방정식)
$$A'A\hat{x} =A'b$$
#### Best estimation of $\hat{x}$
$$\hat{x} = (A'A)^{-1}A'b$$

The projection of b onto the column space is the nearest point A$\hat{x}$: 

#### Projection P
$$P=A\hat{x}=
A(A'A)^{-1}A'b$$

If b is in the column space(or A is invertible): P = b

If b is in the left-null space: P = 0 column space and left-null space is perpendicular.


If A has independent columns then A'A is square symmetric and invertible.

$$P=A(A'A)^{-1}A'$$

Properties

1. P is idempotent. (P^2=P)
2. P is symmetric. (P'=P)



## Orthogonal Matrix Q

1. Q'Q=I
2. P=QQ'


Why length should be 1?

Answer) To calculate simply in Gram-Schmidt Process

#### Gram-Schmidt Process & Orthonormalization

Gram-Schmidt Process is to orthogonalize each vectors with projections, and orthonormalization is normalizing vector size into 1.

q벡터는 각각 직교하고 행렬R은 상삼각행렬이다.
