# Chapter 6. Positive Definite Matrices(양정치행렬)

If a matrix A is positive definite, the following satisfy:
1. x'Ax>0
2. All eigenvalues are positive
3. det(A)>0
4. All pivots are positive
5. Symmetric A is positive definite <=> there exists a matrix R with independent columns such that A=R'R

If the equality above holds, the matrix A is positive semi-definite.

### The Law of Inertia

C'AC has the same number of positive/negative/zero eigenvalues each.


### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Motivation: At chapter 5, we saw diagonalization in square matrices. Now we observe general rectangular matrices.

Singular Value Decomposition: Any m by n matrix A can be factored into A=U∑V'

The columna of U(m by m) are eigenvectors of AA', and the columna of V(n by n) are eigenvectors of A'A.

The r singular values on the diagonal of ∑(m by n) are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of both AA' and A'A.

AA' = (U∑V')(U∑V')'= U∑∑'U' and similarly, A'A = V∑'∑V'.

If A is positive definite, U∑V' = QDQ'. If also symmetric, all negative eigenvalues become positive at ∑.

IF A is SVD, the its pseudoinverse is A^+ = V(∑^+)U' (A'Ax^+ = A'b from the SVD.)

### The Rayleigh Quotient

Minimize R(x) = x'Ax/x'x

Miminal value is the minimum value of the matrix's eigenvalue because of the diagonalization(or SVD).
